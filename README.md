Install from PyPI.

pip install google-generativeai

Obtain an API-Key from https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey, and configure it in place of line 3 (api_key=(your api key))

This project was fairly straightforward, however I did encounter some issues with OpenAI's API not recognizing my API Key properly. After numerous attempts, the API blocked me from sending any furher requests unless I paid a fee. I ended up using Google's AI Python SDK API instead. Overall, generative AI is fascinating in the sense of how much information it can learn and be trained on. We can use it to perform numerous tasks, such as image recognition, language model training, and much more.
